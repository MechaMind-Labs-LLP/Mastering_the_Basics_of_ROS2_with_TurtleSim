## ü§ñ Part 2: Speaking Robot - Core ROS2 Concepts

Let's start by launching our simulator, **TurtleSim**.

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

A new window with a turtle will appear. Keep it open. Open a **new terminal** for the following commands.

### **Nodes: The Brains of the Operation**

A ROS2 system is a collection of processes called **nodes**. Each node has a single purpose. The `turtlesim_node` you just ran is a node responsible for the simulation.

  * **List running nodes:**

    ```bash
    ros2 node list
    ```

    You'll see `/turtlesim`.

  * **Get info about a node:**

    ```bash
    ros2 node info /turtlesim
    ```

    This shows everything the node publishes, subscribes to, services it offers, etc.

### **Topics: The Communication Channels**

Nodes exchange data on **topics**. A node can **publish** (send) messages to a topic, and any number of other nodes can **subscribe** (receive) messages from it.

  * **List all topics:**

    ```bash
    ros2 topic list
    ```

  * **Echo topic data:** Let's spy on the turtle's position data.

    ```bash
    ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose
    ```

  * **Publish to a topic:** Let's send a command to make the turtle move in a circle.

    ```bash
    ros2 topic pub --once /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0}, angular: {z: 1.0}}"
    ```

### **Messages: The Language of Topics**

Data is sent on topics via **messages**. Each topic has a specific message type.

  * **Find a topic's type:**

    ```bash
    ros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel
    ```

    You'll see the type is `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`.

  * **Show a message's structure:**

    ```bash
    ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
    ```

    This shows the fields inside the message, which tells you how to structure the command you published earlier.

### **Services: The Question & Answer**

For request/response interactions, nodes use **services**. A **service client** sends a request, and a **service server** performs a task and returns a response.

  * **List all services:**

    ```bash
    ros2 service list
    ```

  * **Show a service's structure:**

    ```bash
    ros2 interface show turtlesim/srv/Spawn
    ```

    This shows the `request` fields (what you need to provide) and the `response` fields (what you get back).

  * **Call a service:** Let's create a new turtle.

    ```bash
    ros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn "{x: 2.0, y: 8.0, name: 'turtle2'}"
    ```

    A new turtle will appear in the simulation\!

## üìÇ Part 3: Deep Dive into the Project Packages

This repository is structured into three key packages within the `src/` directory.

### **`turtle_msgs`**

This package defines the custom "language" for our project. It contains our custom message and service definitions.

  * `msg/AliveTurtle.msg`: A message to broadcast the position and name of a newly spawned turtle.
  * `msg/KillTurtle.msg`: A message to request that a specific turtle be killed by its name.
  * `srv/ComputeRectangleArea.srv`: A service definition that takes `length` and `width` and returns the `area`.

### **`turtle_script`**

This package contains all our Python nodes‚Äîthe "brains" of our turtles. Each file is a different node with a specific job.

  * **`circle_drawer`**: Makes the turtle drive in an expanding spiral.
  * **`polygon_drawer`**: Draws a polygon with a configurable number of sides and length.
  * **`area_service_server` & `area_service_client`**: The server and client nodes for our custom area calculation service.
  * **`turtle_spawner` & `turtle_controller`**: The two main nodes for our "Catch 'em All" game.

### **`turtle_bringup`**

This package contains **launch files**, which allow us to start and configure multiple nodes with a single command.

  * `polygon_drawer.launch.py`: Starts the simulator and the polygon drawing node.
  * `catch_them_all.launch.py`: Starts the simulator and all nodes required for the game.

## üèÜ Part 4: Running the Projects

Let's see our nodes in action\!

### **Project 1: The Area Service**

1.  **Terminal 1 (Run the Server):**

    ```bash
    ros2 run turtle_script area_service_server
    ```

2.  **Terminal 2 (Run the Client):**

    ```bash
    ros2 run turtle_script area_service_client
    ```

3.  **Run the Client with Parameters:**

    ```bash
    ros2 run turtle_script area_service_client --ros-args -p length:=12.5 -p width:=4.0
    ```

### **Project 2: The Polygon Drawer**

We will use the launch file, which makes this much simpler.

1.  **In a single terminal, run:**
    ```bash
    ros2 launch turtle_bringup polygon_drawer.launch.py
    ```
    This single command starts both the simulator and the drawing node. The turtle will begin drawing a 5-sided polygon with a side length of 2.5, as defined in the launch file.

### **Capstone Project: "Catch 'em All"**

This project showcases a complete ROS2 system with multiple nodes interacting through topics and services.

1.  **In a single terminal, run:**

    ```bash
    ros2 launch turtle_bringup catch_them_all.launch.py
    ```

    This will:

      * Start the TurtleSim window.
      * Start the **`turtle_spawner`**, which will begin adding new turtles at random locations.
      * Start the **`turtle_controller`**, which will identify the closest target turtle and begin chasing it.

    Watch as `turtle1` autonomously chases and "catches" the other turtles, which then disappear. This is a complete, miniature robotics application\!
